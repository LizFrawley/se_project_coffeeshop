# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would maybe add some images of the proposed coffee shop. Maybe some pictures of coffee or something along those lines. Make the page more inviting. I might also list the flavors of coffee and tea so customers can have to information listed for them.
